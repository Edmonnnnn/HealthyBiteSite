      "title": "Why we created Healthy Bite",
      "p1": "We were tired of diets that work only in before/after photos, but not in real life. Strict bans, guilt after every \"mistake\" and the feeling that food controls you — not the other way around.",
      "p2": "Healthy Bite grew out of a simple idea: small realistic changes plus a smart assistant that helps you stay consistent. Without toxic fitness culture, magic detoxes or rigid lists of \"forbidden\" foods.",
      "p3": "Our goal is not to turn your life into endless calorie counting. We want you to understand your own patterns and build a way of eating that supports your energy, mood and health for years."
